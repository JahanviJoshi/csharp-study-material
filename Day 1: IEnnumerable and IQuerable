Q1) what is the difference between IEnummerbale and IQuerble
Ans: IQuerable and IEnumerable are both Interface in c# used for LINQ (Language Integrated Query) operations, 
but they differ in their intended use and performance characteristics.
IEnumerable is designed for working with in-memory collections, while IQuerable is designed for querying data sources that are not entirely in memory, such database.

key difference:

Namespace:
IEnumerable: It is defined in the System.Collections namespace.
IQueryable: It is defined in the System.Linq namespace.

In essence:
 -Use IEnumerable when you have data in memory and you need to perform simple filtering, sorting or other operations on that data directly.
 -Use IQuerable when you're querying a data source (like a database) and you need to leverage server-side processing for efficiency especially with large or complex queries.

Example to Understand the Differences Between IEnumerable and IQueryable in C# :
  In this demo, we will create a Console Application to retrieve the data from the SQL Server database using the Entity Framework Database First approach. We are going to fetch the following Student information from the Student table.
